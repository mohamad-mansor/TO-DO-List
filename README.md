# TO-DO-List

**To-Do List App**

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks. The application stores tasks locally using the browser's localStorage feature, so tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.

### Features:

- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks by typing into the input box and clicking the "Add" button or pressing the Enter key.
- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them. Completed tasks are visually distinguished by a strikethrough.
- **Remove Task**: Tasks can be removed by clicking the "×" button next to them.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are stored locally using the browser's localStorage, ensuring that tasks persist even after closing the browser.

### How to Use:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the **index.html** file in your preferred web browser.
3.  Use the input box to add tasks.
4.  Click on a task to mark it as completed, or click the "×" button to remove it.
5.  Tasks will be saved locally and will persist even after refreshing the page.

### Files:

- **index.html**: HTML file containing the structure of the web application.
- **style.css**: CSS file containing the styles for the application interface.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file containing the functionality for adding, marking, and removing tasks, as well as saving and loading tasks from localStorage.
